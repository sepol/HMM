HMM
---

This project is some basic python code implementing parts of a Hidden Markov Model.  Viterbi decoding is complete, but several other operations are still being implemented.  This includes the parameter updates in Viterbi training and the Forward-Backward algorithm.  I plan to work more on this at some point, but for now, I'm sharing it as-is.
